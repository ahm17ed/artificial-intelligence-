                    <ul>
                        <li> Artificial intelligence is going to change every industry, but we have to understand its limits.
                        </li>
                        <li>The principle limitation of AI is that it learns from the data. There is no other way in which knowledge can be incorporated. That means any inaccuracies in the data will be reflected in the results. And any additional layers of prediction or analysis have to be added separately.
                        </li>
                        <li>Todayâ€™s AI systems are trained to do a clearly defined task. The system that plays poker cannot play solitaire or chess. The system that detects fraud cannot drive a car or give you legal advice. In fact, an AI system that detects health care fraud cannot accurately detect tax fraud or warranty claims fraud.
                        </li>
                        <li>In other words, these systems are very, very specialized. They are focused on a single task and are far from behaving like humans.
                        </li>
                        <li>Likewise, self-learning systems are not autonomous systems. The imagined AI technologies that you see in movies and TV are still science fiction. But computers that can probe complex data to learn and perfect specific tasks are becoming quite common.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                   </font></h2>
